# Tinder: Image Handling System

## Features required
Ask the interviewer whether these features are required:
1. **Storing Profile:** Images will be stored in the profile. How many images per user - let us say 5.
2. **Recommend Matches:** Number of active users?
3. **Note Matches:** Some percentage of active users, say 0.1%.
4. **Direct Messaging**

They are probably going to say yes to first few features. So, use the order with which you are most comfortable. Also, don't take-up too many features as it will consume a lot of time.

Lastly, ask about the scale at which the application is to be used, the user base etc.

## Storing Images: File vs Blob
The total number of Images is going to be very large as it is a some multiple of the number of users (5 x Users in our case). The question is whether we want to store those images as a **File in a Distributed File System** or as a **Blob (Binary Large Objects) in a DB**.

### Why store in FileSystem?
1. Read/write to a DB is always slower than a file system. If you store large files in DB, then it may slow down the performance because a simple query to retrieve the list of files or filename will also load the file data if you used `select *` in your query. In a file system, accessing a file is quite simple and light weight.
2. Your DB backups become huge, which makes restoration & replication slower. (It is a problem where daily size is in TBs)
3. Access to the files now requires going through your Application and Database layers. (It increases the application memory requirements).
4. Allows usage of lightweight web-server/CDN/Amazon S3 for serving.
5. Cost effective, file servers are much cheaper compared to database.
6. Avoids database overhead with its CRUD operations.
7. Easier in cases where files (images, video, audio etc) are to be shared with third party providers.

### Why store files in DB?
1. DB provides ACID compliance(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for each row.
2. DB provides data integrity between the file and its metadata.
3. Database Security is available by default.
4. Backups automatically include files, no extra management of file system necessary.
5. Database indexes perform better than file system trees when more number of items are to be stored.
6. File deletion/updation is always in sync with row operations, no extra maintenance needed.

### Conclusion
It is better to use File system if:
* Your application is responsible for handling large files (i.e. over 5MB) and the lots of file uploads.
* Your application will have a large number of users.

It is better to use DB if:
* Your userâ€™s file needs to be more tightly coupled, secured, and confidential.
* Your application will not demand a large number of files from a large number of users.

## Profiles, Images and Gateway Services
* Using the above conclusions, we will be using File System to store profile images.
* Our DB will store ImageId, ImageURL and ProfileId. The ImageURL is the URL of the Distributed File System where the image is stored.
* The user can talk to our ***Profile Service*** to register, update his profile, upload new image etc. All of these requests must be accompanied by a user token for authentication and authorization.
* We can actually improve this design by introducing a ***Gateway Service*** which handles all the communication with the Client. All other services must receive requests from Client and send responses to them via the ***Gateway Service***.
* It is the job of the ***Gateway Service*** to ask the ***Profile Service*** whether the request is authenticated or not. This tells the ***Gateway Service*** whether to respect the request or not. If the request is to be respected, the request will be directed to the correct service. Once the  ***Gateway Service*** receives the response, it will be sent to the client.
* Another functionality we can decouple from ***Profile Service*** is storing images. We can create an ***Image Service*** for this.
* The ***Image Service*** will have access to a ***Distributed File System*** where it will store the images. It will also have a DB to store ImageId, ImageURL and ProfileId.
