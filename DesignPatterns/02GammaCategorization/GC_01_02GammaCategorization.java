/*
Gamma Categorization:
Design patterna are typically split in three categories. This is called Gamma Categorization after
Erich Gamma, one of the authors of the original Gang of four book : 'Design Patterns: Elements of 
Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994)'

1. Creational Patterns: Deal with creation/contruction of Objects -- explicit (contructor) vs implicit
    (Dependency Injection, reflection etc.), wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (ste-by-step)
    creation.
2. Structural Patterns: Concerned with the structure (e.g. class members). Many patterns are wrappers
    that mimic the underlying class interface. Stress the importance of Good API design.
3. Behavioral Patterns: They are all different; there is no central theme.
