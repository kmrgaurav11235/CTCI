- State design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. It is used when an Object change its behavior 
    based on its internal state.
- An object transitions from one state to another (something needs to trigger the transition).
- A formalized construct that manages state and transitions is called a state machine. 

- If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state, we can have a state variable in the Object. 
    Then, we can use if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the state.

    {code}
    if(state.equalsIgnoreCase("ON")){
        // Turn it off
    } else if(state.equalsIgnoreCase("OFF")){
        // Turn it on
    }
    {/code}
    
    However, if number of states increase then the tight coupling between implementation and the client code will be 
    very hard to maintain and extend.

- State design pattern is used to provide a systematic and loosely coupled way to achieve this through Context and 
    State implementations. State Pattern Context (here LightSwitch class) is the class that has a State reference to 
    one of the concrete implementations of the State. Context forwards the request to the state object for processing.

- The benefits of using State pattern to implement polymorphic behavior is clearly visible. The chances of error are 
less and itâ€™s very easy to add more states for additional behavior. Thus making our code more robust, easily maintainable 
and flexible. Also State pattern helped in avoiding if-else or switch-case conditional logic in this scenario.
