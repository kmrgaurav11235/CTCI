Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time 
and resources and you have a similar object already existing. Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to 
copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs. Prototype design 
pattern uses java cloning to copy the object.

e.g. Suppose we have an Object that loads data from database. Now we need to modify this data in our program 
multiple times, so itâ€™s not a good idea to create the Object using new keyword and load all the data again 
from database. The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new object and then do the 
data manipulation.

Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying should provide the copying feature. 
It should not be done by any other class. However whether to use shallow or deep copy of the Object properties 
depends on the requirements and its a design decision.
