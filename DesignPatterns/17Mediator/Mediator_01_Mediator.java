- Mediator design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern, so it deals with the behaviors of objects. 
    It is used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system. 
- The intent of mediator pattern is to allow loose coupling by encapsulating the way disparate sets of objects 
    interact and communicate with each other. It allows for the actions of each object set, to vary independently 
    of one another.
- Mediator design pattern is very helpful in an enterprise application where multiple objects are interacting with 
    each other. If the objects interact with each other directly, the system components are tightly-coupled with 
    each other that makes higher maintainability cost and not hard to extend. Mediator pattern focuses on providing 
    a mediator between objects for communication. It thus helps in implementing lose-coupling between objects.

- Air traffic controller is a great example of mediator pattern where the airport control room works as a mediator 
    for communication between different flights. Mediator works as a router between objects and it can have itâ€™s 
    own logic to provide way of communication.
- The system objects that communicate each other are called Colleagues. Usually we have an interface or abstract 
    class that provides the contract for communication and then we have concrete implementation of mediators.
