- Given two numbers 'a' and 'b', write a program to count number of bits needed to be flipped to 
    convert 'a' to 'b'.
- Example :
    1) 
    Input : a = 10, b = 20
    Output : 4
    Binary representation of a is 00001010
    Binary representation of b is 00010100

    2)
    Input : a = 7, b = 10
    Output : 3
    Binary representation of a is 00000111
    Binary representation of b is 00001010

- Algorithm:
  1. Calculate XOR of A and B, A ^ B.
  2. Count the set bits in the above. Each '1' in the XOR represents a bit that is different between 
    A and B.

- Counting set bits in an integer
- Simple Method:
    Loop through all bits in an integer, check if a bit is set. If it is, then increment the set bit 
    count. See the method: countSetBitsSimple().
- Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm:
    * As we know from 'BM_07_AUsefulOperation', subtracting 1 from a decimal number flips all the bits 
        after the rightmost set bit(which is 1) including the rightmost set bit.
    * For example :
        10 in binary is 00001010
        9 in binary is 00001001
        8 in binary is 00001000
        7 in binary is 00000111
    * So if we subtract a number by 1 and do bitwise & with itself (n & (n-1)), we unset the rightmost 
        set bit. If we do (n & (n-1)) in a loop and count the number of times loop executes, we get the 
        set bit count.
    * The beauty of this solution is the number of times it loops is equal to the number of set bits in a given integer.
- Algorithm:
    1)  Initialize count = 0
    2)  While n is not zero
        a) Do bitwise '&' with n and (n-1) and assign the value back to n
            n = n & (n-1)
        b) Increment count by 1
    3) return count
