/*
- Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next 
    piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. 
- Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy 
    if the problem has the following property: At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the 
    moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.
- In other words, Greedy Choice property is: a locally optimal solution leads to a globally optimal solution.
- Some examples of Greedy Algorithms: Selection sort, Insertion sort, Topological Sort, Prim’s Minimum Spanning 
    Tree, Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree, Activity Selection Problem, Fractional knapsack problem. In all 
    these problems, the Greedy choice property holds.
