Write a program to print all possible sub-lists that you can make out of a given list.
Lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_odcqzHGqw
e.g.
List = {Jane, Bob, Matt}
All possible sub-lists:
{}, {Jane}, {Bob}, {Matt}, {Jane, Bob}, {Jane, Matt}, {Bob, Matt}, {Jane, Bob, Matt}

Note that the order is not important here.

    Decision Tree:
    The order of selection is not important here. A bad way to solve this problem is to solve it similar to previous
    problem, i.e. to make the selection of all possible elements at one step:
    1) Create two lists: selected = {} and remaining = {<All elements>}
    2) For each of the elements in the list 'remaining':
        - Select the element - remove it from 'remaining' and add it to 'selected'.
        - Explore recursively.
        - Backtrack - Remove it from 'selected' and add it to 'remaining'.
    
    But, this is a bad solution as it takes 'Order of elements' in account, e.g. it will print {Bob, Matt} and 
    {Matt, Bob} separately.

    A better Decision tree will be based on whether an element is to be included or not:
